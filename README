This is a project I did for my Computation Physics (PHYS 401) class. 
It searches for closed orbits in a specific three-body problem. Note 
that many of the methods used here are not suitable for public-facing 
applications. This project does not scale well, none of the main 
operations are behind login walls, and the debug is set to True. This 
project should be viewed as a proof-of-concept.

There is more info in the project write-up, which is a file named 
"report.pdf".
